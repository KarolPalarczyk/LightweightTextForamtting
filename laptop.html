Laptop

<p>
A laptop, often called a notebook computer or simply a notebook, is a
small, portable personal computer (PC) with a “clamshell” form factor,
typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside
of the upper lid of the case and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside
of the lower lid. Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus
are suitable for mobile use. They run on battery power or an external
power adapter that charges the battery while also supplying power to the
computer itself.

Laptops combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a
desktop computer, including the display screen, small speakers, a
keyboard, hard disk drive or solid-state drive, optical disc drive
pointing devices (such as a touchpad or trackpad), a processor, and
memory into a single unit. Most modern laptops also feature integrated
webcams and built-in microphones. For more detailed information, you can

<h3>
Types of laptops
</h3>
<p>
Traditional laptops are designed for general-purpose use, balancing
performance, portability, and price. These are the most common type
found in offices and homes, suitable for tasks like web browsing,
document editing, and media consumption. They typically feature screen
sizes ranging from 13 to 15 inches and offer a standard set of ports and
connectivity options.

Ultrabooks represent a category of high-end subnotebooks designed to be
extremely thin and light without compromising battery life. Originating
from specifications set by Intel, these devices often use low-power
processors and solid-state drives to achieve a slim profile. They are
ideal for business travelers and students who need a device that is easy
to carry all day but still powerful enough for productivity workloads.

Gaming laptops are specialized computers designed primarily for playing
computationally demanding video games. They differ from standard laptops
by including high-performance graphics cards (GPUs) and powerful
processors, which often require larger cooling systems and bulkier
chassis. While they sacrifice some portability and battery life compared
to ultrabooks, they offer performance comparable to desktop gaming rigs.

<h3>
Laptop hardware
</h3>
<p>
The hardware architecture of a laptop is similar to that of a desktop
computer, but the components are miniaturized and optimized for mobile
use and power efficiency. Due to the limited space within the chassis,
many components like the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) may be
soldered directly onto the motherboard, unlike the modular parts found
in desktops. This integration helps reduce the device’s thickness and
weight but often restricts the ability to upgrade individual parts
later.
</p>
<p>
Thermal management is a critical aspect of laptop hardware design, as
powerful components generate significant heat in a confined space.
Laptops use sophisticated cooling systems involving heat pipes, heat
sinks, and compact fans to dissipate heat efficiently. Modern laptops
also increasingly rely on solid-state storage to improve speed and
durability, as these drives are more resistant to physical shock than
traditional spinning hard drives, making them safer for portable use.
